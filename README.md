# Funnel 
funnel is lightweight distributed scanner.

funnel is a tool for distributed processing of arbitrary commands on arbitrary EC2 servers.
Like Gundam's pod-type funnel bit.

As a first feature, netscan is implemented using nmap.
This distributes tcp/udp scans for specific IP ranges and receives the results in a commander.
